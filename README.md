# Clicky-Game

# What was accomplished 
- Check out the example solution and study the app's basic functionality.
- Create a new React application using Create React App.
- The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.
- The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image - for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
- Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
- When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for - instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.

# User test cases
- open a home page with friends images
- click on the image and check the scoring
- if image clicked once the score increases if twice the score decrises 
Fun to have a cute pictures! super positive game!
